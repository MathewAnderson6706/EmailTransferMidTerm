### MidTerm

Purpose of this project is for my Midterm.  It demonstrates my understanding of how to use fragments, FragmentManager to pass data between fragments,
TabLayout to host the fragments, and many implementations/widgets used in those fragments like the following:

First Fragment
- AutoComleteTextView field that gets populated from an array
- A button that validates if the user put in a real email, if not, it sets off a setError
- If it is a real email, it will use the FragmentManager to pass the email to second fragment

Second Fragment
- Updates the TextView with the value passed from the First Fragment
- If no data is passed, has the label "NO DATA"
- Contains a Rating Bar with 5 stars, and a button.  User is able to select the number of stars, and once the button is clicked, it displays that number in a snackbar

Third Fragment
- Contains an ImageView and a clock using TextClock that is continuously updating
- When the user moves away from this fragment, it displays a toast with a counter and my name
